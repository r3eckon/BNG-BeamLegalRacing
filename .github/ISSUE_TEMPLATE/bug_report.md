## READ BEFORE CREATING ISSUE

### DO NOT CREATE ISSUES ABOUT THE MOD BEING BROKEN BY A BEAMNG UPDATE. 

### If the game has seen as major update (ex from 0.34 to 0.35) the mod will most likely break. 

### Be patient while I update the mod.

## Issue Creation Guidelines

* Use english when creating issues. Use google translate if you don't speak english.

* Before reporting an issue go through the troubleshooting guide and check open issues to see if someone else already reported your problem.

* Before reporting an issue look at the **known issues** section of the main repository readme for a list of issues that cannot currently be fixed

* Attach log files, reproduction steps and any other information that can help fix the issue you are reporting. The more information you give the faster your issue will be fixed. Issues without log files, screenshots, reproduction steps, etc. are near impossible to fix.

### This message is a placeholder. After carefully reading through it, remove it from your issue.
