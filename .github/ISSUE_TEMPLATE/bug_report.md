### IMPORTANT: DO NOT CREATE ISSUES ABOUT THE MOD BEING BROKEN BY A BEAMNG UPDATE. If the game has seen as major update (ex from 0.34 to 0.35) the mod will most likely break. Be patient while I update the mod.

Before reporting an issue go through the troubleshooting guide and check open issues to see if someone else already reported your problem.

Attach log files, reproduction steps and any other information that can help fix the issue you are reporting.

This message is a placeholder, remove it from your issue.
