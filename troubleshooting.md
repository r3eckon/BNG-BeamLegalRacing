# Troubleshooting
If you are experiencing issues with the mod please follow these steps before reporting them to confirm the bug is with BeamLR.

## Step 1 - Update Game & Mod
Make sure that you are on the latest version of the game and BeamLR. Even though the mod may not be compatible with the latest game version bug reports relating to compatibility with new BeamNG updates are useful and such bugs are usually addressed in quickly released hotfixes.

Also try verifying integrity of game files through Steam in case some corrupt game files might be to blame.

## Step 2 - Careful Reinstall
A lot of problems can be caused by incorrect installation. Back up your career files before reinstalling to ensure you don't lose any progress. Make sure to carefully follow the install instructions. You should then be able to restore your backup using the in game options menu or, if this fails to work, by manually overwritting the fresh BeamLR folder with your backup.

## Step 3 - Clean Userfolder

Installing the mod in a clean [userfolder](https://documentation.beamng.com/support/userfolder/) can solve most issues caused by incorrect installation or conflicting mods.

1. **Backup your existing userfolder** to keep user data such as custom configs, mods, parameters, BeamLR career progress, etc.
2. Delete the userfolder
3. Start BeamNG to create a new userfolder
4. Close BeamNG
5. Install BeamLR **carefully following the instructions**

If this process fixes your issue this means you either installed incorrectly the first time or something in your userfolder was conflicting with the mod. 

If you absolutely must play with other mods, add them one at a time and test to make sure there are no conflicts. 

## Still having issues? 

If your issue can be reliably reproduced, take note of steps needed to recreate the problem and mention them in your bug report. 

Attach your log files (found inside the userfolder) to your bug report. Do not post screenshots of error pop-ups in game, this error message is useless most of the time.

Once again to remove unrelated output, delete these files before the error happens. The "beamng-launcher" log files are unrelated and don't need to be attached to your bug report.

Finally, please attach to your bug report any screenshots, videos or information you think could help fix the issue. List any steps you took to try to fix the issue. 

The more comprehensive your bug report is, the faster the bug will be fixed.
