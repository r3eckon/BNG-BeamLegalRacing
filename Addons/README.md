# Addons
BeamLR addons are compatibility files needed to run certain extra content. It is recommended to only use addon files for content (mods) you have installed otherwise some unexpected behavior can occur such as bugged/empty maps showing in the map selector.

## Installing & Updating Addons
To install or update addons:
* Download the addon zip file
* Drop it inside your BeamNG **mods** folder (tell OS to replace existing files when updating)

That's it. Addons are read only and can safely be installed in the mods folder like regular non-repo mods.

**Remember to update addons with new releases of BeamLR!**

Make sure you read the addon readme for extra information on specific addons.
## Mod Loading Order Information
Since BeamNG has no mod sorting / loading order feature, addons zip files have to be prefixed in a way that makes them load after content they are trying to modify. This shouldn't be a worry for regular users and only relevant for users trying to create their own addons.
