# Addon: Part Images
Adds part images for most vanilla vehicles to part buying and part editing menus. Images are available in different quality formats. Due to the size of the zip archives they are stored on google drive as github doesn't have the best download speeds.

## Download
* [Max Quality PNG Files (846 MB)](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=15DlztSoRbiOd9-BC4hYP--Kx0rHOiEWc&export=download)
* [High Quality JPG Files (433 MB)](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1cWYzPkEROJXlExKFX8nz7I32xYbUg9QK&export=download)
* [Low Quality JPG Files (114 MB)](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1w3aoQNzxh1wYsqOuKiJlhLqaE8ydt6vM&export=download)

For most players the **High Quality JPG Files** archive is the best compromise between file size and image quality. **Max Quality PNG Files** have lossless compression and the most accurate colors but can increase loading times when the UI needs to load a lot of images all at once (happens for wheels). **Low Quality JPG Files** are more heavily compressed and artifacts can be visible when viewing full size images, they are still adequate for use as thumbnails if you don't plan on viewing the full size images often.

## Tips
The options menu contains a setting for full size image viewer scaling mode. **Original Size** mode will show the images at native resolution so smaller images will not fill the UI app. **Scale To Fit** mode will stretch smaller images so they fill the UI app. The app can also be resized and moved as needed.

Files inside **userfolder/ui/modules/apps/beamlrui/partimg** are made obsolete by this addon and this folder can be deleted.
