# Community Translations
Files listed here are available translations for BeamLR. These files translate both IMGUI and HTML UI apps text. Due to the vanilla translation files not translating part names, slot names, tuning variables and other strings these will unfortunately also not be translated in BeamLR.
## Install Instructions
1. Download a translation file
2. Add the file into the folder beamLR/locales

Tip: to download a translation file you have two options
1. Right click > Save link as... (or equivalent for your browser)
2. Left click > Click the "Download raw file" button (shown below)

Once the scenario is started, a script will automatically merge vanilla translations with BeamLR translations before reloading the UI. Once the scenario is running you can switch between languages as needed. If you select languages that don't have installed translation files the mod will be displayed in English.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any profanity,  offensive language, incorrect translations, broken UI formatting or any other issues that may negatively impact your experience when using community translations. If you run into such issues, let me know and I will deal with the problem accordingly.
