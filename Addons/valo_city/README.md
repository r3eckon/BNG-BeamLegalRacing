# Addon: Valo City (valo_city)
Adds compatibility for the Valo City mod level from SLRR. This map can be [downloaded from the BeamNG mod repository](https://www.beamng.com/resources/valo-city.26648/).  

## Contents
* Map mission loader
* Edited level (decalroads, triggers, waypoints)
* Career implementation files (mapdata, car shops) 
* Career gameplay files (deliveries, challenges, races)

## Install Instructions
### IMPORTANT: You must extract this addon directly in your userfolder, the same way as the core BeamLR mod. 

Using the addon as a zip file in the mods folder may result in problems with progress files.

## Tips

Use the **Green Club Garage** spawn to be close to mission loader.

This level contains night lights which may impact performance depending on your hardware. An optimized light manager has been added to help reduce the amount of enabled lights while keeping a decent night experience. The light manager can be disabled from the options menu.

## Version Information
This addon is currently built for map version **0.79**.
